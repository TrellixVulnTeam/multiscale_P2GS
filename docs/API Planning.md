API planning for multiscale-imaging
=========================

The multiscale-imaging project started off as a few personal scripts, but it is quickly morphing into a full library.
Several inconsistencies are popping up as this project grows, particularly in how similar function calls do or do not
work.  A consistent API will help reduce these inconsistencies and make this project easier to use for other users.

The first step will be to create API classes for users to interact with, instead of an array of functions

## Top level classes
#### BulkFileHandler
#### RegistrationHelper

## Mid level classes
#### ImageTileProcessor
#### 


## Independent callable functions
